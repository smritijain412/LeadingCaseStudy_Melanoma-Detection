# LeadingCaseStudy_Melanoma-Detection

Case study on Melanoma Detection. Apply CNN on classification.Apply simple model first after the analysis on result, found that adding dropout layer prevent from overfitting anand normalize the data.
After that augment data to increase the dataset and rotate in mmultiple way so that model shouldnot be overfitted
